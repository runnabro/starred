            <p className="p">Our homepage was focused on showing users what type of code they could run. After we built up regular returning user base, we wanted to incentivize users to continue to create new content. We wanted to build the smoothest path to creating content and showcase that content right on the homepage.</p>

              <p className="p">When we started, CodeSnippets was not a responsive webapp even though user base was at ~30% mobile users (it‚Äôs even higher today). While working on the product, I gradually rewrote our front-end to be more semantic, accessible, and responsive.</p>
