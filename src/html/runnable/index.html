        <p class="p">I worked on project for most of my time at Runnable. Our priority was to make it as easy for individual developers to use by positioning ourselves as an essential part of their everyday workflow.

        <p class="p">Before starting with product, prospective users are funneled to our marketing page. It‚Äôs one of the best opportunities we have to convince them to give our product a shot! I collaborated with our product manager and <em>the other</em> designer to work on everything design and more; including copywriting and writing Javascript for the interactions we needed. Our current version is the result of dozens of iterations as our product and marketing strategy has evolved.

        <h2 class="h2">Working With Code, Not Builds</h2>
        <p class="p">When exploring how to show running code to users we noticed many CI tools listed code by build number, but identifying builds by number makes it hard to identify what code is running. By showing code by the commits and branches a developer creates, we are designing our product for the developer workflows.

        <p class="p">Teams trying Runnable were also switching to Docker. Since Docker is an important part of getting your code running, we made it easy to define environment. Users who didn‚Äôt have a Dockerfile yet, would be able to create a template based on their environment needs.

        <h2 class="h2">The Design Process</h2>
      </article>
        <!-- <h1 class="h1">A Use Case in Runnable</h1>
        <h2 class="h2">The spec review.</h2>
        <p class="p">Our product manager wrote a <a class="link" href="//runnable.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOT/Spec%3A+Auto-launch+branch+environments+from+other+repositories+in+the+compose+file"><span class="span">spec</span></a> based on feedback we were receiving from clients who were having issues setting up Runnable within their organizations. The ability to launch environments across different repositories from a single Compose file is a feature that our clients have requested. Our design team usually gets involved here. We help define specs by writing or expanding on the initial draft, collecting data, and writing proposals.
        <h2 class="h2">What went wrong?</h2>
        <p class="p">We always imagined that our product could be enjoyed by everyone at an organization. We assumed that if a developer were working on a project, they would have full access to their code. But our clients had DevOps engineers configure their environments, and they did not always have  access to the code base for the projects that developers were working on. So in order to get set up, they would need to do two things:
          <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">Maintain <strong class="weight-strong">Compose files</strong> per project.
            <li class="li">And convince project leads to add a configuration file to their repositories.
          </ol>
        <p class="p">We found there wasn‚Äôt a standard practice for where teams should keep their Compose files. There were two primary methods: keep your files in the same repository, or keep your DevOps files separate. Our current product implementation allowed for the first, but not the latter. We needed a way for our product to work for both methods.
        <h2 class="h2">Pen, Whiteboards, Sketch üíé</h2>
        <p class="p">Starting with pen & paper allows me the freedom to explore solutions at a rapid pace. I‚Äôm never afraid of trying ‚Äúdumb‚Äù ideas, because my sketchbook is a personal format.
        <figure class="grid-block col align-center figure">
          <img class="img" src="/images/runnable/pen-1.jpg">
          <figcaption class="figcaption">What it might look like for users to choose Compose files.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="p">Once we have working ideas to share, we‚Äôll call our first design critique. Having a whiteboard critique promotes feedback: participants are less shy when discussing work that‚Äôs obviously unfinished, and anyone can easily add to or modify work on a whiteboard.
        <figure class="grid-block col align-center figure">
          <img class="img" src="/images/runnable/whiteboard-1.jpg">
          <figcaption class="figcaption">A slightly more refined version of the previous sketches for critique.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="p">After incorporating feedback from our critique, we‚Äôll share wireframes with the team in a Google Drawing. The drawings are meant to help our engineers understand how the feature should work, and for everyone to have an easy way to give feedback. In this wireframe, we wanted to show users a preview of their environments before committing to creating the cluster. We also updated our navigation to accomodate the additional environments we‚Äôd need to show users.

          <figcaption class="figcaption">Early wireframes we shared with our team.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="p">At this point, we felt that what we had would be too ambitious to implement in time. We ended up splitting this project into 2 iterations. For our first iteration, we would reuse our existing onboarding flow, but keep the updates to our navigation.

        <h2 class="h2">üåà Implementation land.</h2>
        <p class="p">Our designers help write the front-end for our projects. So once we‚Äôre all onboard, I‚Äôll task out the design work in the engineering JIRA board. As we work on each task, we use feature flags to toggle UI changes.

        </figure>
        <p class="p">Users add their Compose file the same way they did before; but now, we‚Äôll parse their Compose file for references to other GitHub repositories and launch environments from those repositories as well.

        <p class="p">We‚Äôll write the logic for actions, loading states, etc. before testing our UI changes. Then we‚Äôll create a QA checklist that our engineers use as a guide for writing their own tasks and later for bug bashes. We‚Äôll also add handlers for any events that need to be pushed to our analytics setup in MixPanel and setup UserTesting tests.
