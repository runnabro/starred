            <p class="p">Before getting to use the product, everyone starts on the marketing page. It’s one of the best opportunities we have to convince you to give our product a shot. My team pushed me to develop my skills in copywriting, illustration, and Javascript. Our marketing pages were built similarly to our product and we made changes often to reflect the changes to our product.

            <p class="p">Building <a class="link" href="//runnable.com/blog"><span class="span">our blog</span></a> was a new challenge for me. Working with our engineers to write posts helped me realize how important writing is in the products we design. When looking at the tone of what we’ve written to users, I’ve learned to ask myself how our users are feeling; “Are you eager to get started now, or are you feeling frustrated?”.

            <p class="p">We needed users to use Docker, but when we were getting started we found out that everyone was new to Docker. Every application needed a Dockerfile that defined the configuration for their environment. So we built a tool that made it easy to set up Dockerfiles. Users would see configuration suggestions based on the language of their project.

If users choose to manage their Dockerfile in their repo, project collaborators could use Runnable without ever using our app. Those same environments can be exposed to PMs and QA teams in Jira and Slack integrations too.
