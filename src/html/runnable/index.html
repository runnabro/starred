            <p class="p">Before starting with product, prospective users are funneled to our marketing page. It’s one of the best opportunities we have to convince them to give our product a shot! I collaborated with our product manager and <em>the other</em> designer to work on everything design and more; including copywriting and writing Javascript for the interactions we needed. Our current version is the result of dozens of iterations as our product and marketing strategy has evolved.

            <p class="p">Teams trying Runnable were also switching to Docker. Since Docker is an important part of getting your code running, we made it easy to define environment. Users who didn’t have a Dockerfile yet, would be able to create a template based on their environment needs.

            <p class="p">When exploring how to show running code to users we noticed many CI tools listed code by build number, but identifying builds by number makes it hard to identify what code is running. By showing code by the commits and branches a developer creates, we are designing our product for the developer workflows.
