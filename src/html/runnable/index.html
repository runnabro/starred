            <p class="p">Before starting with the product, you’ll likely start on our marketing page. It’s one of the best opportunities we have to convince you to give our product a shot! For these pages, I didn’t just limit myself to design work. My team pushed me to develop skills in copywriting, illustration, and improving my Javascript chops. Our current pages are the result of dozens of iterations as our skills developed along with our product strategy.

            <p class="p">Building our blog wasn’t the hard part, it was learning how to edit posts. Being asked to work with our engineers to write posts made me realize how important writing is in product design. It’s not enough to come up with <em class="em">what</em> to say, but <em class="em">how</em> to say it too. When looking at the tone of what I’m writing to users, I’ve learned to ask myself how our users are feeling; “Are you eager to get started now, or are you frustrated?”.

            <p class="p">When we were just getting started, nearly every team was new to Docker, and we needed Dockerfiles to build environments. We needed to build an experience that was friendly to users who weren’t familiar with how to write those files. To help users build their Dockerfiles, our onboarding experience started with taking in project code and exposing Docker features as a simple interface.

            <p class="p">While figuring out how to bring environments to developers, we saw that most CI tools presented code by build number. But identifying builds that way makes it hard to identify exactly what is running. We wanted our environments to mirror what developers were already doing by presening environments as branches.

Our users rave to us about how accessible their environments are with our GitHub integration, and those same environments are exposed to PM and QA teams in Jira.
