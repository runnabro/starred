          <p class="p">When I joined the team, Runnable was already a functional product (now CodeSnippets). We were building a platform for developers to find, run, and share their code.
          <h2 class="h2">Homepage Improvements</h2>
          <p class="p">Our original homepage was focused on helping users discover code, but it required you to search, or browse by language before being able to run code. New users didn‚Äôt even know what to search, and browsing was a convoluted way to get to running code. We set our sights on building the shortest path to code in order to make it easy for users to create content and increase return visits.

            <h2 class="h2">Creating Content</h2>
            <p class="p">Before, the only path to creating a code example was with the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button in the header. And only after starting the create flow would you be able to see what languages we supported. We were consistently hearing from users that they didn‚Äôt know what languages we supported.
            <p class="p">To make it a single click to getting your code running, we exposed our create flow in the hero. Users would no longer need to start the flow to see what we could do for them.

            <h2 class="h2">Fresh Code</h2>
            <p class="p">Finding code examples meant you needed to search or click through categories. We wanted users to feel the code they were running was new and easy to get to.
            <p class="p">We built a feed showcasing new code examples to encourage return visits, and we designed auto-generated feed pages for every tag (including user submitted ones!) to foster ownership.

            <p class="p">One of the defining features of CodeSnippets is that users have access to their environment through our web terminal. We gave users more control of their environments by exposing the commands that defines how their environment is launched.

            <p class="p">When we started, our userbase sat at ~70% desktop users. And today we see a total reversal with 70%+ mobile users. Throughout the months of active development until <a href="/runnable" class="link"><span class="span">our pivot</span></a>, I gradually rewrote CodeSnippets to be more semantic, accessible, and responsive.
