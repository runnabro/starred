          <p class="p">When I joined the team, Runnable was already a functional product (now CodeSnippets). Our goal was to help developers find, run, and share their code.
          <h2 class="h2">Rethinking Our Homepage</h2>
          <p class="p">Our homepage was focused on helping users discover code, but it required our users to search, or browse by language (or framework) before being able to see code. We went to work redesigning this page with two goals in mind: increasing user created content, and return visits.

            <h2 class="h2">Creating Content</h2>
            <p class="p">On our first homepage, the sole path to creating a code example is with the “Create” button in the header. We were consistently getting feedback that users didn’t know what languages we supported.
            <p class="p">To make it so users were just one click from getting the code in their language running, we exposed our create flow front and center.

            <h2 class="h2">Stickiness</h2>
            <p class="p">The paths to finding code examples required users to either search or click through categories. We wanted the value we provided the be immediately tangible and feel “fresh”.
            <p class="p">To encourage return visits and reduce the gap to seeing running code, we implemented a feed for new and popular content. We also generated feed pages for every tag (including user submitted ones!).

            <p class="p">One of the defining features of CodeSnippets is that users have access to their environment. We expanded on that by giving users the ability to execute commands before the environment is launched and to define how their environment is launched.

            <p class="p">When I joined the team, our userbase sat at ~70% desktop users. Today, we’re looking at 70%+ mobile users. Throughout the months of active development <a href="/runnable" class="link"><span class="span">our pivot</span></a>, I slowly rewrote CodeSnippets to be more semantic, accessible, and responsive.
