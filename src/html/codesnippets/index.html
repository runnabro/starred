          <h2 class="h2">Rethinking Our Homepage</h2>
          <p class="p">Our homepage was focused on discovering code examples, but it required our users to search, or browse by language (or framework) before being able to see code. We rethought our page with two primary goals:
          <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">
              <p class="p"><strong class="weight-bold">Acquisition.</strong> In our new design, users would be able to see and start creating new snippets from the hero. Previously, users needed to find the “Create” call-to-action in the header.
            <li class="li">
              <p class="p"><strong class="weight-bold">Stickiness.</strong> Below the hero, our page was static, and then two clicks removed from viewing code. We implemented a feed for new and popular content to increase daily usage with content that our users could access in a single click.
          </ol>

          <img class="img img-wrapper" src="/images/codesnippets/screenie-1.png">
          <figcaption class="figcaption">Our previous homepage with static content.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="text-container p">In addition to our new homepage, we automatically built feeds for every tag (including user submitted ones!) for better discovery.

            <img class="img img-profile" src="/images/codesnippets/screenie-3.png">
          </div>
          <p class="p">We added profiles to each code snippet for the same reasons for rethinking our homepage. Users were able to use their profile to keep track of their code snippets and their profile would also appear on their contributions.

          <h2 class="h2">Build & Runtime</h2>
          <p class="p">One of the defining features of CodeSnippets is that users have access to their environment. We expanded on that by giving users the ability to execute commands before the environment is launched and to define how their environment is launched.

          <h2 class="h2">Refactoring for Mobile</h2>
          <p class="p">When I joined the team, our userbase sat at ~70% desktop users. Today, we’re looking at 70%+ mobile users. Throughout the months of active development our pivot, I slowly rewrote CodeSnippets to be more semantic, accessible, and responsive.
