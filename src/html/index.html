            Hey,
          </h1>
          <p class="p">I’m Tony and I work on the web. My current challenge is to help dev teams at <a class="link" href="//runnable.com"><span class="span">Runnable</span></a>. Here’s what I’ve been doing:
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <ol class="grid-block col ol ol-work">
          <li class="grid-block col li">
            <div class="grid-block shrink img-wrapper img-runnable">
              <img class="img" src="images/ss-runnable.png">
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
              <h2 class="h2 weight-strong">Runnable</h2>
              <p class="p">We want to enable teams to launch environments at the same rate they can push code. Including design, my team pushed me to expand my skillset in product management, analytics, user testing, and copywriting.
              <div class="grid-block">
                <a class="btn btn-primary" href="//runnable.com"><span class="span">View It Live</span></a>
                <a class="btn btn-secondary" href="/runnable/">Read Details</a>
              </div>

            <div class="text-container">
              <h2 class="h2 weight-strong">CodeSnippets</h2>
              <p class="p">This was the first project we worked on when I joined the team. Our mission was to make it super accessible to run and share code in the browser. I built on this project by designing and coding features focused on building our community; eventually helping us reach over 500,000 unique visits per month!

              <h2 class="h2 weight-strong">/docker</h2>
              <p class="p">We set out to build a resource to help developers learn how they can use Docker to containerize their services. I designed and built this project with Jekyll, which we reused as the framework for our docs.

            <div class="text-container">
              <h2 class="h2 weight-strong">Runnable Docs</h2>
              <p class="p">Our docs project has evolved from using Zendesk’s Help Center, to a GitBook project, and in our current iteration, Jekyll. Recently, we worked hard to revamp how our docs are presented to our readers. And not just a new visual experience, we rewrote existing articles to focus on onboarding users, and wrote new ones where we found gaps in knowledge our users would need to find success.
