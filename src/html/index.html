            Hey, I’m Tony and I work on the web.
          </h1>
          <p class="text-container p">My current challenge is to help dev teams at <a class="link" href="//runnable.com">Runnable</a>. Here’s what I’ve been doing:
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <ol class="grid-block col ol ol-work">
          <li class="grid-block col li">
            <div class="grid-block shrink img-wrapper img-codesnippets">
              <img class="img" src="images/ss-codesnippets.png">
            </div>
            <h2 class="text-container h4 weight-strong">CodeSnippets</h2>
            <p class="text-container p">This was the first project we worked on when I joined the team. Our mission was to make it super accessible to run and share code in the browser. I built on this project by designing and coding features focused on building our community; eventually helping us reach 500,000 unique visits per month!
            <div class="grid-block text-container">
              <a class="btn btn-primary" href="//code.runnable.com/"><span class="span">View It Live</span></a>
            </div>
          <li class="grid-block col li">
            <div class="grid-block shrink img-wrapper img-runnable">
              <img class="img" src="images/ss-runnable.png">
            </div>
            <h2 class="text-container h4 weight-strong">Runnable</h2>
            <p class="text-container p">Unlimited environments for all. We’re building a service that enables teams to launch environments at the same rate they churn out code. This was the most challenging project I worked on. Including design, my team pushed me to expand my horizons in product management, analytics, user testing, and copywriting.

              <a class="btn btn-primary" href="//runnable.com"><span class="span">View It Live</span></a>
              <a class="btn btn-secondary" href="">Product Screenies</a>

            </div>
            <h2 class="text-container h4 weight-strong">/docker</h2>
            <p class="text-container p">We set out to build a resource to help developeres learn about how they can use Docker to containerize their services. I built this project with Jekyll, which we reused as the framework for our docs.
            <div class="grid-block text-container">
              <a class="btn btn-primary" href="//runnable.com/docker/"><span class="span">View It Live</span></a>

            <div class="grid-block shrink img-wrapper img-docs">

            </div>
            <h2 class="text-container h4 weight-strong">Runnable Docs</h2>
            <p class="text-container p">In the code, our docs project evolved from using Zendesk, to GitBook, and in our current iteration, Jekyll. But recently, we also worked hard to revamp how our docs are presented to our readers. We didn’t just design a new visual experience, we edited existing articles with a focus on new users, and wrote new ones where we found gaps in knowledge that users would need to find success.
