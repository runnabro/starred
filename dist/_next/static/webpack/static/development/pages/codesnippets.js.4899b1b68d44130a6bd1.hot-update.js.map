After we built up regular returning user base, we wanted to incentivize users to continue to create new content. We wanted to build the smoothest path to creating content and showcase that content right on the homepage.</p>\n            <figure className=\"grid-block col align-center figure figure-oldsnippets\">\n              <img className=\"img img-wrapper\" src=\"/images/codesnippets/old-home.png\" height=\"403\" width=\"450\" />\n              <figcaption className=\"figcaption\">Our homepage when starting the project.</figcaption>\n            </figure>\n          </section>\n          <section className=\"grid-block section section-callout section-hero\">\n            <div className=\"text-container\">\n              <h2 className=\"h2\">Creating Content</h2>\n              <p className=\"p\">Rhe only path to creating a code example was with the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button in the header.

We wanted code creators to have their content recognized, and our consumers to feel the code they were looking at was always revolving.</p>\n              <p className=\"p\">We built a feed on the homepage to showcase new code and designed pages that were automatically generated for user selected tags.</p>\n            </div>\n            <figure className=\"grid-block col shrink figure figure-xl figure-nodejs\">\n              <div className=\"img-wrapper img-nodejs\">\n                <img className=\"img\" src=\"/images/codesnippets/tag-page.png\" height=\"484\" width=\"760\" />\n              </div>\n            </figure>\n          </section>\n          <section className=\"grid-block section padding-bottom-none section-callout section-profiles\">\n            <div className=\"text-container\">\n              <h2 className=\"h2\">Creator Recognition</h2>\n              <div className=\"grid-block align-center\">\n                <img className=\"img no-shadow img-profile-widget\" src=\"/images/codesnippets/profile-small.png\" height=\"70\" width=\"200\" />\n              </div>\n              <p className=\"p\">To further encourage content creators, we added user profiles to give them visibility throughout CodeSnippets.

Later, we gave users more control of their environments by exposing the configuration of their environments.</p>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n          <section className=\"grid-block col section section-mobile\">\n            <div className=\"text-container\">\n              <h2 className=\"h2\">Mobile Refactoring</h2>\n              <p className=\"p\">When we started, CodeSnippets was not a responsive webapp even though user base was at ~30% mobile users (it‚Äôs even higher today). While working on the product, I gradually rewrote our front-end to be more semantic, accessible, and responsive.</p>\n            </div>\n            <figure className=\"grid-block figure figure-xl figure-mobile\">\n              <img className=\"img no-shadow\" src=\"/images/codesnippets/mobile/screenie-1.png\" height=\"529\" width=\"253\" />\n              <img className=\"img no-shadow\" src=\"/images/codesnippets/mobile/screenie-2.png\" height=\"529\" width=\"253\" />\n              <img className=\"img no-shadow\" src=\"/images/codesnippets/mobile/screenie-3.png\" height=\"529\" width=\"253\" />\n            </figure>\n          </section>\n          <section className=\"grid-block col section padding-top-none\">\n            <p className=\"text-container p\">\n              Thanks for reading.
